# Judgement-Game

Judgment is a game where you have to predict the number of hands you'll make and try to make those number of hands that you predict.  It is a game usually for 3 or more players.  Even 2 players can play but then the game won't be that interesting.  5 players can play the game using one deck of 52 cards.  Jokers have no role here.

# How to play
After the cards are dealt, the player who got the 1st card first will be the first to predict the hands that he will make after looking at the cards.  The trump is spades in the first game.  With ten cards given to each player, there is a possibility of making a maximum of 10 hands.

All the other players, at their turn (in counterclockwise direction) make their predictions on the number of hands they will make.  As an example, assume the 1st player made the prediction of 5 hands, Player 2 of three hands, Player 3 of one hand and Player 4 of four hands.  After the predictions are over, the game begins with player who was dealt the 1st card first playing first.

Suppose the first player plays the King of Hearts, and all the players have hearts with them so that the trump is not played but no one has the ace of hearts, so the King of hearts wins over other cards of hearts and he makes a hand.
